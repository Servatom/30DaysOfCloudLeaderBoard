<h2 align='left'>Overview</h2>
Here is the website :  https://30daysofgcp.dsctiet.tech/


The project consists of a single page site and an app having a leaderboard table with search functionality to easily find a particular participant by name, and a couple of graphs showing the general point trends. The graphs have been made using `react-chartjs-2` npm package in the web version and `syncfusion_flutter_charts` in the app. The leaderboard encourages the participants to proceed with their challenge by giving the top scorer(s) a crown <img src="https://assets.servatom.com/DSC/gcp/crown.jpeg" height="16px"> against their ranks. This has been done to promote healthy competition among the participants and appreciate the enthusiasm of those who finished the challenge before time!
